# Predicting movie genres using movie metadata and posters
### - by JY, LD and CH

The purpose of this project is to predict movie genres to better assist targeted advertising. An advertising company can advertise more effectively based on the genre type that matches clients’ preference or basic demographic information. Movie metadata from IMDB and TMDB together with the movie posters were used as predictors, and the genre labels from TMDB were used as the response. 

A major challenge of this study is that each movie may have multiple genre labels and belong to several classes. This type of problem is multi-label classification, where the classes are not mutually exclusive. To handle the multi-label classification, the movie genres were binarized (one-hot-encoded), and various modeling methods were applied including the traditional machine learning models, such as logistic regression, random forest and boosting, as well as convolutional neural network. 

## Data
The dataset includes the 1000 most popular US produced English language movies within each primary released year of 2012-2016 with genre labels, resulting in a dataset with about 6000 entries.

- #### Metadata
    Most of the movie features are from TMDB, including: Release year, Release month, Vote count, Vote average. Additional information such as runtime and aspect ratio was downloaded from IMDB. 
- #### Text data
    Text analysis was performed on movie titles and TMDB reviews to obtain insights from high frequency words. Given the high dimensionality of the text data and the large number of words with only a few occurrences, words appearing more than 30 times in movie titles and more than 200 times in movie reviews were selected as features. This resulted in 124 features in total. 
- #### Posters
    Movie posters were downloaded from TMDB to for genre prediction in deep learning models.
